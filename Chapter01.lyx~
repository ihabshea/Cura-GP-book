An integrated collection of expert systems with the aim of the identification,
 recognition, diagnosis, patient follow-up and help in the treatment journey
 for three main types of cancer: 
\series bold
brain
\series default
,
\series bold
 breast 
\series default
and 
\series bold
gastric (stomach) 
\series default
cancer is proposed to serve both doctors who seek to automate a part of
 the general practicioner's job and use a system that will help along the
 journey of diagnosis, follow-up and treatment, and patients who want their
 questions answered starting from the very first phases before the confirmation
 of the illness to later phases of treatment (e.g: chemotherapy), as well
 as keeping up with how their health is doing so far in an easily accessible
 way.
 The system is planned to be available for both doctors and patients using
 different applications in a way that will make it possible for both parties
 to access crucial data in the right times.

Motivation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
By the end of 2018, an estimated 1,735,350 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed
 in the United States alone with an estimated 609,640 people will die as
 a result of the disease.
 By observing different cases from 2011 to 2015, an estimated 0.00439% (around
 439 per 100,000) of men and women are diagnosed with cancer each year,
 while during the same period, the estimated number of deaths resulting
 from cancer was 163 per 100,000.
 Death as a result of cancer is slightly higher in men with an estimated
 197 per 100,000 compared to an estimated 140 per 100,000 for women.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
According to data collected in the period of 2013-2015, it is estimated
 that 38.4% of both men and women will get diagnosed with cancer at some
 point in their lives.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cancer has impacted societies around the world in different ways, the numbers
 aforementioned show approximately how impactful cancer had been and it
 serves as a wake up call for people who never thought of cancer as a danger
 they might have to anticipate at some point in their lives.

\begin_layout Standard
In the most basic terms, cancer is an umbrella term for a group of related
 diseases that all share a common characteristic: an unstoppable division
 of the body's cells that spread into sorrounding tissues.
 Cancer can basically start in any of the trillions of cells that make up
 the human body; normally, human cells grow and divide to form new cells,
 but the cells grow old or somehow get damaged, they die, and new cells
 take their place.

\series bold
Glycation 
\series default
(or non-enzymatic glycosylation) is the result of a covalent bond formed
 between a sugar molecule (i.e: glucose or fructose) to a protein or lipid
 molecule, without the controlling action of an enzyme.
 Glycation may either occur inside the body (endogenous glycation) or outside
 the body (exogenous glycation).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
Excogenous glycation 
\series default
refers to the formation of 
\series bold
Advanced Glycation Endproducts (AGES)
\series default
 when sugars are cooked with proteins and fats; typically temperatures over
 248

 (
\begin_inset Formula $\sim120\textdegree C)$
\end_inset

 greatly spur the reactions, that being said, lower temperatures with longer
 (or slow) cooking also promote the formulation.
 Such compounds are absorbed during digestion with about 10% efficiency;
 browning effects are evidence of pre-formed glycations, for example: sugar
 is often an ingredient in many french fries and baked good recipes to promote
 browning.
 Glycation may contribute to the formation of acrylamide a potential carcinogen,
 during cooking.

\series bold
Endogenous glycations 
\series default
describe the type of gylcations occuring mainly in the bloodstream to a
 small percentae of the absorbed simple sugars (e.g: glucose, fructose and
 galactose).
 The effects of fructose were formely drastically underestimated due to
 the use of inaccurate assay techniques, but it turned out to have effects
 that are approximately ten times worse than the effects of glucose which
 is considered the primary body fuel.
 Some AGEs are benign, but some are much more effective than the sugars
 they are derived of.
 AGEs contribute to the development of cancer, along with a massive list
 of other diseases including cardiovascular diseases, usually when covalent
 bonds are formed between the sugars and collagens.
 The list goes on to include Alzheimer's disease as a result of the formation
 of amyloid proteins as a side-product of AGES, deafness due to demyelination.
 Long-lived cells, such as nerves, long-lasting proteins (such as crystallins
 of the lens and cornea), and DNA may accumulate substantial damage over
 time.
 Damage by gylcation results in the stiffness of collagen in the blood vessel
 walls, usually leading to diabetes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A telomere is a region at the end of a chromosome, often called the tail
 of the chromosome.
 Telomeres usually contain repetitive nucloetide sequences to protect the
 end of the chromosome from deterioration or from fusion with neighbouring
 chromosomes.
 During the process of chromosome replication, the enzymes that duplicate
 DNA can not continue their duplication all the way to the end of the chromose,
 so each time the end of the DNA is shortened, this is mainly contributed
 to the synthesis of Okazaki fragments which require RNA primers attaching
 ahead on the lagging strand.
 Basically, telomeres are truncated during cell divsion; their presence
 protects genes contained in the chromosome from being truncated instead.
 The telomeres themselves are protected by shelterin proteins along with
 the RNA that telomeric DNA encodes (known as TERRA).
 When telomeres get too short, the cell can no longer divide resulting in
 it being inactive or dead; this shortening process is associated aging,
 cancer and death.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When cancer develops, the orderly process of cell division is broken down;
 cells become more and more abnormal, damaged cells survive when they are
 supposed to die, and new cells are formed when they are not needed, these
 new cells divide continuously without stopping and may form tumours.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cancerous tumours are malignant, meaning they can spread to nearby tissues,
 and as tumours grow, some cancer cells break off and travel to distant
 places in the body through the blood or the lymph system and form new tumours
 in places other than the origin of the tumour.
 In contrast with malignant tumours, benign tumours do not spread to nearby
 areas, and while they can be quite large, once they are removed they usually
 do not grow back; most benign tumours are safe except the ones that grow
 in the brain.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Cancer cells are not as specialized as normal cells, meaning that normal
 cells mature into very distinct cell types while cancerous ones do not,
 that is why cancerous cells keep dividing in an unstoppable fashion.
 That is in the addition to the fact that cancerous cells are programmed
 to ignore signals that tell cells to dividing, a process called programmed
 cell death, or apoptosis, which the body utilizes to get rid of unncessary
 cells.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The microenvironment, or the area sorrounding and feeding a tumour could
 be hugely influenced by cancer cells that may be able to affect the normal
 cells, molecules and blood vessels.
 As an example of such an effect, cancer cells could prompt normal cells
 to form blood vessels that supply the tumours with oxygen and nutrients
 which they need to grow.
 Cancer cells can dodge the immune system and specialized cells that protect
 the body from infections and other conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Being a genetic disease, cancer is caused by changes to genes that control
 the way our cells function, especially how they divide and grow.
 Such genetic changes could either be inherited from the patient's parents
 or from errors during the patient's lifetime that occur as cells divide
 or as a result from DNA damage caused by certain environmental exposures,
 e.g: tobacco smoking, consumption of unrefined sugars and grains, radiations
 such as UV rays from the sun.

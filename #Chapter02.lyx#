\size large
Background and Related Work
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
This project draws upon several diverse fields including bioinformatics,
 computer science, blockchain, nudge behavioural psychology and game theory.
 The purpose of this chapter is to give a general sense of how each of these
 areas affected the project, as well as point to similar projects that gave
 rise to this project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
This chapter discusses the approach used to recognise and treat cancer,
 along with motivational incentives for doctors and specialists to willingly
 share their relative data sets.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section

\size large
Behavioural Psychology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
Cura's system is particulary interested in nudging, in which small changes
 are introduced to an individual's choice set to push individuals towards
 certain behaviour without much change to their current routine.
 Usually employed techniques include

Blockchain
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
Blockchain technology has been the revolution recently, and the introduction
 of Ethereum was especially revolutionary because it had the goal of building
 decentralized applications set from the beginning, as opposed to Bitcoin,
 that mainly focused on financial transactions.
 Decentralized applications, as promising as they are perceived to be, are
 in fact very limited and uncompetitive against traditional centralized
 applications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
The use of blockchain in CuraCG's projects is to create an incentive-based
 project to help grow the scientific community built on top of the CuraCG's
 subsystems.
 A special token named CuraToken (CT for short) is issued at a certain rate,
 which is to be discussed in CuraTherapy's white and yellow papers, 
\begin_inset Note Note

\size large
to incentivise oncologists to share their data sets whether, especially
 the ones they built prior to them starting to use CuraCBR in order to have
 an evergrowing repository of datasets related to cancer and related diseases
 for the reasons aforementioned including better understanding of cancer
 on molecular and cellular levels.
\end_layout

 The incentive program employs blockchain research and techniques built
 on behavioural psychology and game theory.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section

\size large
Pattern Recognition
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
Pattern recognition is a mature field that is still very fast growing and
 exciting.
 It spans different areas including computer vision, image processing, text
 and document analysis, and neural networks.
 It supported huge developments across different applications like biometrics,
 bioinformatics, multimedia data analysis and data science.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
Pattern recognition, by definition, is the process of recognising patterns
 and regularities in data.
 It is closely related to machine learning, sometimes even the terms are
 used interchangeably.
 However, machine learning is one of the approaches used in pattern recognition.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
Different approahces are used in pattern recognition and they could be categoris
ed into two different categories: the first is done by using labeled 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

training
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 data, or in other terms: supervised learning.
 In the case where no labeled data are provided, specialized algorithms
 are used to recognise the patterns in a process called unsupervised learning,
 which is the second category.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section

\size large
Magnetic Resonance Imaging
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an imaging technique that produces high
 quality images of the anatomical structures of the human body, especially
 in the brain, and provides rich information for clinical diagnosis and
 biomedical research.
 The diagnostic values of MRI are greatly magnified by the automated and
 accurate classification of the MRI images.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section

\size large
Wavelet Transform
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
Wavelet transform is an effective tool for feature extraction from MR brain
 images, because it allows analysis of images at various levels of resolution
 due to its multi-resolution analytic property.
 However, this technique requires large storage and is computationally expensive.
 In order to reduce the feature vector dimensions and increase the discriminativ
e power, the principal component analysis (PCA) was used.
 PCA is appealing since it effectively reduces the dimensionality of data
 and therefore reduces the computational cost of analysing new data.
 Then, the problem of how to classify

on

\end_inset

 the input data arises.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section

\size large
Support Vector Machines
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
In recent years, researchers have proposed a lot of approaches for this
 goal, which fall into two categories.
 One category is supervised classification, including support vector machine
 (SVM) and k- nearest neighbors (k-NN).
 The other category is unsupervised classification, including self-organisation
 feature map (SOFM) and fuzzy c-means.
 While all these methods achieved good results, and yet the supervised classifie
r performs better than unsupervised classifier in terms of classification
 accuracy (success classification rate).
 However, the classification accuracies of most existing methods were lower
 than 95%, so the goal of this paper is to find a more accurate method.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
Our approach starts first by segmenting the photos and then using wavelet
 transform to extract features, then applying PCA to reduce the features
 extracted before submitting the reduced features to the Kernel Support
 Vector Machine KSVM classifer and finally using K-fold cross validation
 to enhance the generalisations produced by the KSVM.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section

\size large
Cancer
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
Cancer refers to uncontrollable cells that continuously row and invade bodily
 tissues.
 Cells may turn cancerous due to different factors including accumulation
 of mutations in the DNA.
 Examples of genetic mutations include BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations.
 Cancer could also be caused by terrible lifestyle choices such as the consumpti
on of smoked red meat (e.g: hot dogs and sausages), which are classifed as
 IARC Group 1 carcinogens, meaning they do cause cancer in humans.
 Cells can detect and repair DNA damage most of the time, and the body usually
 gets rid of damaged cells through a process called programmed cell death
 but sometimes cancerous cells can bypass this process to grow, divide and
 spread abnormaly in the tissues of the human body.
 Benign tumours are tumours that grow only in one place and usually do not
 grow back if treated, while malignant tumours grow in and travel to different
 places and hence they are more dangerous.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Cancer Detection
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
There are several ways by which patients can know whether or not they have
 cancer.
 Examples of which will be discussed in this section.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\size large
Complete Blood Count (CBC)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
A sample of blood is tested to measure the amount of various types of blood
 cells.
 Usually this method is used to detect blood cancer if a certain blood cell
 type has too many or too few blood cells or by the existence of abnormal
 cells.
 Usually, bone marrow biopsy could help confirm the diagnosis of a blood
 cancer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\size large
Tumour Marker Tests

\begin_layout Standard

produced by some normal cells, and the levels of which

\begin_layout Plain Layout

\size large

\end_layout

\end_inset

 higher in noncancerous conditions.
 This is usually considered a problem for tumour marker tests to detect
 and diagnose cancer.
 It is rare to only use such a method alone to confirm the diagnosis of
 cancer.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
Examples of such tests include prostate-specific antigen for prostate cancer,
 calcionin for medullary thyroid cancer, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) for liver
 cancer or and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) for germ cell tumours,
 such as testicular cancer and ovarian cancer.
 That said, use of tumour marker tests is still highly controversial.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\size large
Biopsy
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
A test in which a sample of cells or a piece of a tissue is removed and
 analysed in a laboratory with the purpose of diagnosing cancer.
 There are different types of Biopsy tests including:

 as mentioned previously this test is especially important in diagnosing
 blood cancers.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Bone marrow is the spongy material inside some of your larger bones where
 blood cells are produced.
 Analysing a sample of bone marrow may reveal what's causing your blood
 problem.
 A bone marrow biopsy could help diagnose malignant tumours that travelled
 to the bone marrow.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
\size large
Endoscopic biopsy: 
\series default
using a thin, flexible tube with a light on its end to see inside the body.
 The tube usually takes small samples of tissues for later analysis.
 An endoscopic biopsy could be inserted through the mouth, rectum, urinary
 tract or a small incision through the skin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\series bold
\size large
Needle biopsy: 
\series default
using a needle, cells from suspicious areas could be extracted.
 A needle biopsy may be more suitable for tumours that can be felt through
 skin such as suspicious breast lumps and enlarged lymph nodes.

Feature Extraction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
The most conventional tool of signal analysis is Fourier transform (FT),
 which breaks down a time domain signal into constituent sinusoids of different
 frequencies, thus, transforming the signal from time domain to frequency
 domain.
 However, FT has a serious drawback as discarding the time information of
 the signal.
 For example, analyst can not tell when a particular event took place from
 a Fourier spectrum.
 Thus, the quality of the classification decreases as time information is
 lost.
 Gabor adapted the FT to analyse only a small section of the signal at a
 time.
 The technique is called windowing or short time Fourier transform (STFT).
 It adds a window of particular shape to the signal.
 STFT can be regarded as a compromise between the time information and frequency
 information.
 It provides some information about both time and frequency domain.
 However, the precision of the information is limited by the size of the
 window.
 Wavelet transform (WT) represents the next logical step: a windowing technique
 with variable size.
 Thus, it preserves both time and frequency information of the signal.
 The development of signal analysis is shown in Fig.
 2.
 Another advantage of WT is that it adopts “scale” instead of traditional
 “frequency”, namely, it does not produce a time-frequency view but a time-scale
 view of the signal.
 The time-scale view is a different way to view data, but it is a more natural
 and powerful way, because compared to “frequency”, “scale” is commonly
 used in daily life.
 Meanwhile, “in large/small scale” is easily understood than “in high/low
 frequency.

Discrete Wavelet Transform
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is a powerful implementation of the
 WT using the dyadic scales and positions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
The fundamentals of DWT are introduced as follows.
 Suppose x(t) is a square-integrable function, then the continuous WT of
 x(t) relative to a given wavelet ψ(t) is defined as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
W_{\varPsi}(a,b)={\displaystyle \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x(t)\varPsi_{a,b}(t)\,dt}
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
where 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\varPsi_{a,b}(t)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{a}}\varPsi(\frac{t-a}{b})
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
Here, the wavelet 
\begin_inset Formula $\varPsi_{a,b}(t)$
\end_inset

 is calculated from the mother wavelet ψ(t) by translation and dilation:
 a is the dilation factor and b is the translation parameter (both real
 positive numbers).
 There are several different kinds of wavelets which have gained popularity
 throughout the development of wavelet analysis.
 The most important wavelet is the Harr wavelet, which is the simplest one
 and often the preferred wavelet in a lot of applications.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
Formula (1) can be discretised by restraining a and b to a discrete lattice
 (
\begin_inset Formula $a=2^{b}\,\,\&\,\,a>0$
\end_inset

) to give the DWT, which can be expressed as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{align}
ca_{j,k}(n)= & DS[{\displaystyle \sum_{n}x(n)g_{j}^{*}(n-2^{j}k)]}\\
cd_{j,k}(n)= & DS[{\displaystyle \sum_{n}x(n)h_{j}^{*}(n-2^{j}k)]}
\end{align}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
Here 
\begin_inset Formula $ca_{j,k}$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $cd_{j,k}$
\end_inset

 refer to the coefficients of the approximation components and the detail
 components, respectively.
 g(n) and h(n) denote for the low-pass filter and high-pass filter, respectively.
 j and k represent the wavelet scale and translation factors, respectively.
 DS operator means the downsampling.
 Formulas (3) and (4) are the fundamentals of wavelet decomposes.
 It decomposes signal x(n) into two signals, the approximation coefficients
 ca(n) and the detail components cd(n).
 This procedure is called one-level decompose.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
The above decomposition process can be iterated with successive approximations
 being decomposed in turn, so that one signal is broken down into various
 levels of resolution.
 The whole process is called wavelet decomposition tree.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

\size large
2D DWT
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
In case of 2D images, the DWT is applied to each dimension separately.
 Consequently, there are 4 sub-band (LL, LH, HH, and HL) images at each
 scale.
 The sub-band LL is used for next 2D DWT.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
The LL subband can be regarded as the approximation component of the image,
 while the LH, HL, and HH subbands can be regarded as the detailed components
 of the image.
 As the level of decomposition increased, a more compact but coarse approximatio
n component was obtained.
 Thus, wavelets provide a simple hierarchical framework for interpreting
 the image information.
 In our algorithm, level-3 decomposition via Harr wavelet was utilised to
 extract features.
 The border distortion is a technique issue related to digital filter which
 is commonly used in the DWT.
 As we filter the image, the mask will extend beyond the image at the edges,
 so the solution is to pad the pixels outside the images.
 In our algorithm, symmetric padding method was utilised to calculate the
 boundary value.

Feature Reduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
Excessive features increase computation times and storage memory.
 Furthermore, they sometimes make classification more complicated, which
 is called the curse of dimensionality.
 It is required to reduce the number of features.
 PCA is an efficient tool to reduce the dimension of a data set consisting
 of a large number of interrelated variables while retaining most of the
 variations.
 It is achieved by transforming the data set to a new set of ordered variables
 according to their variances or importance.
 This technique has three effects: it orthogonalises the components of the
 input vectors

\begin_layout Plain Layout

so that uncorrelated with each other
\end_layout

\end_inset

, it orders the resulting orthogonal components so that those with the largest
 variation come first, and eliminates those components contributing the
 least to the variation in the data set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
It should be noted that the input vectors be normalized before performing
 PCA to have zero mean and unity variance.
 The normalization is a standard procedure.

 It is mainly used in an application where the goal is prediction.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\size large
In a prediction problem, the model is given a set of known data (i.e: training
 data set) on which training is run, then it is given a set of first-seen
 data, i.e: data that was not used in estimating the model, on which the
 model is tested to flag issues like overfitting and selection bias.
